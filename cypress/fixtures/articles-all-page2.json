      "body": "It may come as a surprise to many, but football has a long and interesting history; sources suggest that the sport was first introduced in England as early as 1170 when an account describes youths going to the fields for a ‘game of ball’. Aspects of the game can even be traced back to as early as the second and third century BC in China. Sources taken from military manuals at the time describe an exercise called Tsu’ Chu, in which opponents used a leather ball filled with feathers and hair. The aim was to get the ball into a small net fixed on to bamboo canes while also defending themselves from attacks. Variations of the game are also documented in Egyptian and Greek society, proving that the sport has a long tradition throughout history.",

      "article_id": 32,
      "body": "CHINA’S cities abound with restaurants and food stalls catering to Muslims as well as to the many other Chinese who relish the distinctive cuisines for which the country’s Muslims are renowned. So popular are kebabs cooked by Muslim Uighurs on the streets of Beijing that the city banned outdoor grills in 2014 in order to reduce smoke, which officials said was exacerbating the capital’s notorious smog (the air today is hardly less noxious). Often such food is claimed to be qing zhen, meaning 'pure and true', or halal, prepared according to traditional Islamic regulations. But who can tell? Last year angry Muslims besieged a halal bakery in Xining, the capital of Qinghai province, after pork sausages were found in the shop’s delivery van. There have been several scandals in recent years involving rat meat or pork being sold as lamb. These have spread Muslim mistrust of domestically produced halal products.",

      "body": "The founder of the Node Security Project says Node.js still has common vulnerabilities, but progress has been made to make it more secure. Appearing at the recent Node Community Convention in San Francisco, project founder Adam Baldwin, chief security officer at Web consulting company &yet, emphasized risks, protections, and progress. Baldwin sees four risks within the Node ecosystem pertinent to the enterprise: the code dependency tree, bugs, malicious actors, and people. I think of [the dependency tree] more as the dependency iceberg, to be honest, Baldwin said, where your code is the ship and your dependencies that you have with your packaged JSON is that little tiny iceberg at the top. But developers need to be aware of the massive iceberg underneath, he stressed.",
