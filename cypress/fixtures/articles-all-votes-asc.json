      "article_id": 4,
      "body": "When I first started learning React, I remember reading lots of articles about the different technologies associated with it. In particular, this one article stood out. It mentions how confusing the ecosystem is, and how developers often feel they have to know ALL of the ecosystem before using React. And as someone who’s used React daily for the past 8 months or so, I can definitely say that I’m still barely scratching the surface in terms of understanding how the entire ecosystem works! But my time spent using React has given me some insight into when and why it might be appropriate to use another technology — Redux (a variant of the Flux architecture).",

      "article_id": 8,
      "body": "You’re probably aware that JavaScript is the programming language most often used to add interactivity to the front end of a website, but its capabilities go far beyond that—entire sites can be built on JavaScript, extending it from the front to the back end, seamlessly. Express.js and Node.js gave JavaScript newfound back-end functionality—allowing developers to build software with JavaScript on the server side for the first time. Together, they make it possible to build an entire site with JavaScript: You can develop server-side applications with Node.js and then publish those Node.js apps as websites with Express. Because Node.js itself wasn’t intended to build websites, the Express framework is able to layer in built-in structure and functions needed to actually build a site. It’s a pretty lightweight framework that’s great for giving developers extra, built-in web application features and the Express API without overriding the already robust, feature-packed Node.js platform. In short, Express and Node are changing the way developers build websites.",

      "body": "When I interviewed for the iOS developer opening at Discord last spring, the tech lead Stanislav told me: React Native is the future. We will use it to build our iOS app from scratch as soon as it becomes public. As a native iOS developer, I strongly doubted using web technologies to build mobile apps because of my previous experiences with tools like PhoneGap. But after learning and using React Native for a while, I am glad we made that decision.",

      "title": "An Introduction to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) in JavaScript and .NET",
      "article_id": 10,
      "body": "When designing an application that will communicate with a remote computer, a data format and exchange protocol must be selected. There are a variety of open, standardized options, and the ideal choice depends on the applications requirements and pre-existing functionality. For example, SOAP-based web services format the data in an XML payload wrapped within a SOAP envelope. While XML works well for many application scenarios, it has some drawbacks that make it less than ideal for others. One such space where XML is often less than ideal is with Ajax-style web applications. Ajax is a technique used for building interactive web applications that provide a snappier user experience through the use of out-of-band, lightweight calls to the web server in lieu of full-page postbacks. These asynchronous calls are initiated on the client using JavaScript and involve formatting data, sending it to a web server, and parsing and working with the returned data. While most browsers can construct, send, and parse XML, JavaScript Object Notation (or JSON) provides a standardized data exchange format that is better-suited for Ajax-style web applications. JSON is an open, text-based data exchange format (see RFC 4627). Like XML, it is human-readable, platform independent, and enjoys a wide availability of implementations. Data formatted according to the JSON standard is lightweight and can be parsed by JavaScript implementations with incredible ease, making it an ideal data exchange format for Ajax web applications. Since it is primarily a data format, JSON is not limited to just Ajax web applications, and can be used in virtually any scenario where applications need to exchange or store structured information as text. This article examines the JSON standard, its relationship to JavaScript, and how it compares to XML. Jayrock, an open-source JSON implementation for .NET, is discussed and examples of creating and parsing JSON messages are provided in JavaScript and C#.",

      "article_id": 9,
      "body": "Both CSS3 and HTML5 are just about fully supported in all modern browsers, and we there are techniques in place to patch old browsers that lack support. So there is no disadvantage to using CSS3 and HTML5 today. The opposite is true, however: there are many painful, frustrating disadvantages with forgoing HTML5 and CSS3. You may already “know” a bit of HTML5 and a touch of CSS3 (or perhaps you probably know enough old-school HTML and CSS), and with this knowledge, you might have thought you needn’t learn HTML5 and CSS3 fully.",

That's a fun fact I'd probably never had known or maybe don't even really need to know, but now I do, thanks to Julia Rothman's Food Anatomy: The Curious Parts & Pieces of Our Edible World. Rothman has an entire series of illustrated Anatomy books, including Nature and Farm, packed with infographics, quirky facts, and maps that you can get lost in for hours—in a fun way, not in a boring textbook way. It makes you wonder why textbooks aren't this fun to read. Can someone look into this? Thanks.",

      "article_id": 15,
      "body": "When Roy Hodgson resigned after this summer’s debacle, the England managerial merry go-round set into motion raising hopes that change would improve the nations fortunes.  In came Sam Allardyce but the same old squad was announced – apart from Michail Antonio – resulting in a similar type performance that was customary this summer. I was an advocate of Big Sam’s appointment because of the fact he managed down the league and could see that talent lay beyond just the big clubs in the country. Roy had many faults but the biggest frustration for me was he failed to utilise an already diminished pool of English players by continuing to pick the so called elite players – who are all tainted with failure. To be fair to Allardyce his first England game came so early in the season that it made making whole sale changes difficult. We shall never know if he would have picked different players. Since he left the job it was up to Gareth Southgate to take on the mantle and again hope arose that he may start to pick some of the talented under 21s that he has worked with over the last five years.",
